## Features

### Core Features

#### Home Page:

- Display a list of all countries with key details (e.g., name, flag, region, and population).

- Add filter options (e.g., filter by region, population range, etc.).
- Country Details Page:

#### Display comprehensive details such as:

- Flag
- Official Name
- Population
- Capital
- Region and Subregion
- Area
- Languages
- Currencies
- Timezones
- Borders (neighboring countries)
- Add an interactive map using a mapping library like Leaflet.js.

#### Routing:

- Use query parameters or dynamic routing to open a detailed page for the selected country (e.g., /country.html?name=Switzerland).
- Enhanced User Experience

#### Responsive Design:

- Ensure the project looks good on all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Use CSS Flexbox or Grid for layout.

#### Dark Mode:

- Add a toggle switch to switch between light and dark themes.

#### Back Button:

- Provide a button to navigate back to the home page from the country details page.
- API and Data Handling

#### Error Handling:

##### Show user-friendly error messages if:
- The API fails to load.
- A country is not found.
- Include a loading spinner while fetching data.

#### Pagination or Infinite Scroll:

- If there are many countries, implement pagination or infinite scroll to improve performance.
- Visual and Interactive Features

#### Interactive Map Integration:

- Add an interactive map to the country details page using Leaflet.js or Google Maps API, pinpointing the country's location.

#### Flag Viewer:

- Allow users to click on the flag to view it in full-screen.


## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

#### API Integration:

- Fetching and handling data from a public API using fetch() or similar tools.
- Managing asynchronous operations with .then() and async/await.

#### DOM Manipulation:

- Dynamically creating and appending elements like country cards to the DOM.
- Updating content dynamically based on user interactions.

#### Routing and Navigation:

- Passing data through query parameters (e.g., /country.html?name=Switzerland) for dynamic page updates.

#### Responsive Web Design:

- Using CSS techniques (e.g., Flexbox or Grid) to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.

#### User Interface Design:

- Designing interactive features like search bars, filters, and back buttons for a smooth user experience.
- Implementing themes like dark mode for accessibility.

#### Error Handling:

- Managing potential API errors and showing user-friendly messages.
- Adding loading indicators for better UX during data fetching.

#### Optimization Techniques:

- Optimizing API calls to improve performance.
- Caching data using localStorage or similar methods.

#### JavaScript Skills:

- Strengthening core concepts like loops, conditionals, and event handling.
- Learning modular code practices for better scalability.

#### Advanced Features:

- Implementing interactive elements like maps or data visualizations with libraries.
- Enhancing functionality with comparison tools or favorite lists.

#### Problem-Solving:

- Debugging and troubleshooting challenges throughout the project.
- Thinking creatively to add features and improve usability.


### Continued development

#### 1. Enhance User Experience

- **Add Animations**: Use CSS or libraries like GSAP to animate country cards, page transitions, or map interactions.
- Offline Access: Implement a Service Worker to cache API responses and make the app accessible offline.
- **Customizable Themes**: Expand dark mode to include more themes (e.g., light, sepia).
- **Accessibility Improvements**: Ensure compliance with WCAG standards, including keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

#### 2. Expand Functionality

- **Favorites List**: Allow users to save their favorite countries locally using localStorage or IndexedDB.
- **Country Comparison**: Let users select multiple countries to compare side by side.
Data Visualizations: Use libraries like Chart.js or D3.js to display population growth, GDP, or other stats.
- **Multilingual Support**: Add support for UI translation and localized data display.
- **Weather Integration**: Fetch and display current weather data for the selected country‚Äôs capital using an API like OpenWeatherMap.

#### 3. Improve Performance

- **Debounced Search**: Optimize the search bar with debouncing to avoid excessive API calls.
- **API Caching**: Cache API responses for faster subsequent loads and reduced network usage.
- **Lazy Loading**: Lazy load images (flags) for faster initial page loads.
- **Pagination**: If displaying all countries is slow, implement pagination or infinite scrolling.

#### 4. Introduce Advanced Features

- **Interactive Map**: Add an interactive map on the details page to show the country‚Äôs exact location using Leaflet.js or Google Maps API.
- **News Integration**: Show recent news or events related to the selected country using a news API like NewsAPI.
- **Historical Data**: Fetch historical data (population, GDP, etc.) for detailed insights.
- **Events Calendar**: Show upcoming holidays or significant events for each country.

#### 5. Modularize Code

- **Refactor Code**: Organize your codebase into smaller, reusable functions or modules. Consider using a framework like React or Vue for scalability.
- **Use Version Control**: Start using Git and host your code on GitHub to track changes and collaborate.

#### 6. Deploy and Share

- **Deployment**: Host your project on platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages for live access.
- **Custom Domain**: Link a custom domain to your project for a professional touch.
- **SEO Optimization:** Add meta tags, keywords, and descriptions for better search engine ranking.

#### 7. Seek Feedback
- Share your project with friends, mentors, or on developer forums like Reddit, Hashnode, or Dev.to.
- Incorporate feedback to improve features, fix bugs, or optimize usability.

#### 8. Learn and Implement New Tech

- **Frontend Frameworks:** Consider migrating to React, Vue, or Svelte for better scalability and advanced features.
- **Backend Integration:** Create a custom backend with Node.js or Python to handle advanced features like user authentication or storing favorites on a server.
- **Database Integration:** Use a database like MongoDB or Firebase to store and manage additional data.
